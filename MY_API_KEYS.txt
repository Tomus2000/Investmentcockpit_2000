===========================================
YOUR API KEYS - FOUND IN CODEBASE
===========================================

I found these API keys in your project. Some are complete, some are partial.
You may have the complete versions saved elsewhere on your OneDrive.

COMPLETE KEYS FOUND:
--------------------


PARTIAL KEYS FOUND (need full versions):
----------------------------------------


===========================================
WHERE TO FIND YOUR KEYS:
===========================================

1. Check your OneDrive for:
   - Notes files (.txt, .md)
   - Password manager exports
   - Email confirmations from API providers
   - Browser saved passwords

2. Check these locations:
   - OneDrive/Documents/ (other folders)
   - Desktop notes
   - Email inbox (search for "API key" or service names)

3. Get fresh keys from:
   - OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Supabase: Dashboard → Settings → API
   - Telegram: @BotFather (for bot token)
   - Finnhub: https://finnhub.io/ dashboard

===========================================
NEXT STEPS:
===========================================

1. Create a .env file in your project root with all keys
2. Or check if you have them saved in another document
3. The .env file is already in .gitignore (won't be committed)
